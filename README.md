> Currently the procedure of Election is: we have to cast our votes by going to a place, filling up a form and then dropping it into a box. One/two weeks later results use to be declared. The Process is bit lengthy and requires lot of physical labour and consumes time. Hence, this idea came to me to develop a system, which can be easily accessible from anywhere inside and outside the campus using a smart-phone or a computer device. This will simplify our life a lot saving our time and our effort.
