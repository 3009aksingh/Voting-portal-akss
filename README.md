> Currently the procedure of Election is: we have to cast our votes by going to a place, filling up a form and then dropping it into a box. One/two weeks later results use to be declared. The Process is bit lengthy and requires lot of physical labour and consumes time. Hence, this idea came to me to develop a system, which can be easily accessible from anywhere inside and outside the campus using a smart-phone or a computer device. This will simplify our life a lot saving our time and our effort. Built a responsive and real-time voting web application, created using NodeJS, MongoDB, Express,
EJS. Performed real-time vote counting using pusher-js package and added feature like reset password. Used Polling API
and CRUD API‚Äôs for counting votes and maintaining users. Analyzed and made the website light weight using gzip
compression technique for fast processing.
